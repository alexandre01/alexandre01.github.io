I'm a Computer Science graduate student at EPFL, Switzerland, specialized in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Before studying at EPFL, I graduated from École Centrale Paris (CentraleSupélec). I'm considering to pursue a PhD programme in Computer Science after completion of my Master.

I worked during one semester on Object Tracking at the Computer Vision Lab of EPFL to reproduce the state-of-the-art (SiamRPN): a fully convolutional siamese convnet extended with a region proposal network.

I am currently working on applying Deep Learning to medical imaging, in collaboration with the Geneva University Hospital.

My interests include Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Quantum Computation.
